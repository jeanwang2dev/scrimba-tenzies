# Scrimba Course Tenzies Preject

## with tailwindcss and webpack5


* Challenge: Start a brand new React app!
  - Create a separate App component
  - Import and render the App component here
  - In the App component, render a <main> element
  - Style everything to look like the slide

* Challenge:
 * 
 * Write a function (allNewDice) that returns an array 
 * of 10 random numbers between 1-6 inclusive.
 * 
 * Log the array of numbers to the console for now

* Challenge:
 * 
 * Create state to hold our array of numbers. (Initialize
 * the state by calling our `allNewDice` function so it 
 * loads all new dice as soon as the app loads)
 * 
 * Map over the state numbers array to generate our array
 * of Die elements and render those in place of our
 * manually-written 10 Die elements.
 
* Challenge: Update the array of numbers in state to be
 * an array of objects instead. Each object should look like:
 * { value: <random number>, isHeld: false }
 * 
 * Making this change will break parts of our code, so make
 * sure to update things so we're back to a working state
